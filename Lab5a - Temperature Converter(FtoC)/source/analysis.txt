2a) I received two errors:

  lab5a.cpp:17:1: error: 'main' must return 'int'
  void main()
  ^~~~
  int

  lab5a.cpp:22:2: error: use of undeclared identifier 'displayWelcomeMessage'
          displayWelcomeMessage();
          ^
  2 errors generated.


4a) To fix the first error, which I believe was unintentional,
  I turned main into an int, then returned 0.

  Two fix the second I did as instructed

7a) Received no errors

9a) Received 1 error:
  Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
  "fahrenheitToCelcius(double)", referenced from:
      _main in lab5a-880daf.o
  ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
